## ✨ Overview

**SkyTrip** is a next-generation AI travel planner designed to replace hours of research, chaotic browser tabs, and fragmented planning notes with a single, unified travel hub. 

Provide your destination, budget, duration, and travel crew, and SkyTrip will dynamically construct a complete day-by-day itinerary complete with live hotel listings, location markers, ticket estimates, and an interactive route-drawn map.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Architecture

SkyTrip is architected using a modern, robust, and highly performant full-stack ecosystem:

*   **Framework:** [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Server Actions, API Routes)
*   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Strict compilation configurations for type safety)
*   **AI Engine:** [Google Gemini API / OpenRouter](https://ai.google.dev/) (Leverages structured schema validation for consistent JSON itinerary structure)
*   **Real-time Database & BaaS:** [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) (Zero-latency reactive data synchronization and edge database operations)
*   **Authentication & Security:** [Clerk Auth](https://clerk.com/) (Secure sign-ins, sign-ups, and user sessions)
*   **Map Integrations:** [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps) (`@react-google-maps/api` for custom markers, path polylines, and dynamic coordinate fitting; Google Places API for context-based hotel and activity image lookup)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Responsive, modern design system featuring custom utility classes)
*   **Animations:** [Framer Motion / Motion](https://motion.dev/) (Fluid layout transitions, timelines, and dynamic page effects)
*   **API Protection:** [Arcjet](https://arcjet.com/) (Protects API routes with token bucket rate limiting and bot detection)

## 🚀 Key Features & Implementation

### 1. 🧠 Structured AI Itinerary Generation
*   Takes user inputs and sends custom prompts to Gemini to construct structured, type-safe JSON itinerary documents containing activities, hotels, details, and exact geographical coordinates.
*   Integrates fallback systems to ensure elegant handling of API errors or format variations.

### 2. 🗺️ Interactive Maps & Dynamic Day Filtering
*   Incorporates a detailed, custom-themed **Google Map** (`GlobalMap`) directly beside the itinerary.
*   **Dynamic Route Drawing:** Select a specific day on the trip timeline to instantly highlight that day's activities. The map dynamically updates its bounds to focus on that region and draws a polyline route (Hotel ➔ Activity 1 ➔ Activity 2 ➔ Hotel).
*   Includes a functional **Overview** resetting action button that instantly centers the map view to display all days and hotels.

### 3. 💬 Real-Time AI Travel Chatbot Assistant
*   Features a persistent floating chatbot (`TripChatbot`) on the trip detail screen.
*   Pre-loaded with the generated trip context so it can immediately answer specific queries (e.g., packing tips, estimated ticket pricing, hotel reviews, food recommendations, and local travel tips).
*   Supports standard typing interactions as well as quick-click suggested questions.

### 4. 🏨 Booking & Places Engine
*   Integrates direct booking redirects to popular booking platforms, appending location-specific parameters.
*   Fetches high-quality location photos on the fly from the Google Places API with robust placeholder fallbacks for when images are unavailable.

### 5. 🎒 Checklist Tracker
*   Auto-populates a packing list (`PackingList`) suited for the duration and theme of the trip, allowing users to check off items as they pack.
